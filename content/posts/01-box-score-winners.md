The standard basketball statistics shown in box scores are notoriously misleading. 

At the very least, they are not standardised by the number of possessions in a game. As a result, you can't use them to compare across games of different speeds. 

Still, given how often they're discussed, it's worth getting a basic sense of what these numbers mean. To start, I wanted to see how associated on the team level they were with winning. For instance, if all you know is that a team had more steals than its opponent, how confident can you be that it won? 

It turns out, not very.

I downloaded box scores from the last 5 NBA seasons (6,561 games) and calculated how often the winner of each game 'won' each box score stat in that game.

The strongest association was with field goal percentage: over the last five seasons, the team that has made a higher share of its field goals has won the game 80% of the time. Only two other team stats I looked at were associated with winning more than 70% of the time: the number of field goals made and the number of defensive rebounds. 

Other numbers had very weak assocations. The team with more attempted threes, more steals, more free throw attempts, more blocks, and a higher free throw percentage rate only won between 50% and 55% of the time. 

It was also interesting that apparently negative stats such as turnovers and personal fouls did not have particularly strong associations with losing: losers only have more of each of these stats about 60% of the time.
